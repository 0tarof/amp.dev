      description: |
        AMP Documents have traditionally not allowed for custom JavaScript, relying on the well built large corpus of Web Components designed and validated to work within AMP.
        
        Today, we release the Kraken. We’ll introduce `amp-script`, allowing your custom JavaScript to operate within AMP Documents with reasonable limits. Now your custom logic can be expressed with the world’s most popular programming language.

    - title: "Growing Up AMP First: Everything I Know I Learned From AMP"
      description: "Too often, engineers view AMP as just one more thing to implement. In reality, AMP provides engineers with a series of guiding principles that can help them deliver more performant websites—even when it comes to non-AMP pages. So, what happens when teams begin to think AMP first? Engineers are able to move beyond mere AMP validation and have a seat at the table in conversations about UX, performance, and even new feature development.  Does that sound crazy? It's not just a pipe dream. In this talk, we will explore AMP's core design principles and unpack how businesses can (and should!) incorporate these principles into all aspects of their decision making.  I will draw on real-life experience and examples from my team's work with top publishers—including LA Times, El Pais, RTL.de, and a recent re-platforming effort at The Washington Post—and reveal how AMP can help teams align on goals and make better decisions at every level."

We draw up many versions of a feature to match the many ways AMP is used. We sit in cafes and talk to your users about how they use the web, and make changes based on their feedback. And since you are *our* users, we want to talk to you about how you work and how future AMP components can make your sites even better."
