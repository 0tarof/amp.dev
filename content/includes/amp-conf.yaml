      description: "Too often, engineers view AMP as just one more thing to implement. In reality, AMP provides engineers with a series of guiding principles that can help them deliver more performant websites—even when it comes to non-AMP pages. So, what happens when teams begin to think AMP first? Engineers are able to move beyond mere AMP validation and have a seat at the table in conversations about UX, performance, and even new feature development.  Does that sound crazy? It's not just a pipe dream. In this talk, we will explore AMP's core design principles and unpack how businesses can (and should!) incorporate these principles into all aspects of their decision making.  I will draw on real-life experience and examples from my team's work with top publishers—including LA Times, El Pais, RTL.de, and a recent re-platforming effort at The Washington Post—and reveal how AMP can help teams align on goals and make better decisions at every level."

A designer from the AMP team talks about how we go from feature requests to shipping components with great documentation. We draw up many versions of a feature to match the many ways AMP is used. We sit in cafes and ask people to talk to us about how they use the web, then we make changes we hope will better serve your users. And since you are *our* users, we want to talk to you about how you work and how future AMP components can make your sites even better.

      description: Share an overarching George.com case study. From the upfront engineering and launch to measuring analytics (which can be difficult), I could sketch out a 30-min overview that encompasses what we learned and the outcomes we measured. This would be a good opportunity to make the connection that AMP and e-commerce works well – and without having to give up too much. George is a prominent brand that adopted AMP and our story would reinforce the industry-wide call to place the user’s experience at the heart of any digital strategy. I’d be willing to flesh this out, as needed. Walk through specific solutions that married AMP and e-commerce. We used a handful of components and techniques, including APIs, to ensure real-time pricing and inventory, as well as cart integration. I’d be able to discuss in more granularity how we addressed some of the common concerns – or misconceptions – about what’s achievable with AMP, with an e-commerce bent.

      description: Living in Erbil, one of my focuses with AMP is deploying web applications that can thrive in war-impacted regions. By combining AMP with Progressive Web Apps, I have found some best practices (such as creative use of AMP lists and AMP forms) for making products that bring important content and excellent experiences to the most unstable regions with unreliable connections, where sometimes the most important messages cannot reach people on social media because of poor/no signal, blocking of social media, trolls that systematically take down progressive Facebook pages, and the threat of jail time just for what might show up on your feed if you have Facebook on your phone. Hosting content and using AMP to deliver content efficiently circumvents many of these obstacles.

      description: "How do you reach out to young digital natives in Kenya? How do you get your content read by users who spend their online life on their smartphones? How do you teach young adults to make responsible financial decisions. How do you compete against far more entertaining content? Not by sending them 800 word blogposts. Not by sending them 150 word infographics. But by sending them AMP Stories. With open rates 6x higher, session time going up from 20 seconds to over 3 minutes, and completion rates of over 85%, we believe that AMP Stories are THE communication format for emerging markets. In most emerging markets, smartphone penetration is high. WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger are the communication channels of choice. Social media Stories are omnipresent. All ingredients are in place for AMP Stories to take the market by storm. We'd like to share our story of how we used AMP Stories to communicate with our customers in Kenya. We'd like to share our belief that this can be replicated in other emerging markets. We'd also like to share how it lead us to developing an AMP storybuilder that we are planning to release by the time of the AMP conference in Tokyo."

In this talk, Ben Kim, Head of UX at iPrice Group, will share some of the challenges that UX teams will face when transitioning into a Canonical AMP environment and how UXers at iPrice have adapted in delivering the best user experience as possible for an audience of 16 million visitors a month from 7 different countries through qualitative UX research and site-wide AMP experiments."
